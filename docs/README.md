## 1. Introduction

The **Smart360** application enhances medical education by bringing immersive, scenario-based learning into the classroom. Using the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach, students can step into various medical scenarios, experiencing them through the perspectives of different roles. This allows them to observe realistic situations, reflect on their observations, and engage in meaningful discussions guided by their teacher. **Smart360** provides a cost-effective alternative to traditional role-playing exercises, enriching medical training with a unique, virtual experience.

### Key Features
- **Virtual Reality (VR)**: Provides an immersive learning environment, allowing students to engage deeply with medical scenarios through hands-on virtual reality experiences.
- **Multi-Scenario Variances:** Provides different pre-recorded variations of a scenario, each featuring unique circumstances and challenges to enhance the learning experience.
- **Multi-Role**: Enables users to switch between different roles (e.g., doctors, nurses, patients), offering a comprehensive understanding of each perspective and their interactions within the scenario.
- **360° Videos**: Immersive 360-degree video places students at the center of the action, allowing them to observe the environment and interactions happening around them.
- **Role Videos**: Displays role-specific actions and interactions in dedicated video windows alongside the 360° video, providing focused insights into each participant's activities.
- **Timeline**: A synchronized timeline ensures that 360° videos and role-specific videos remain in sync, allowing learners to follow the scenario's progression in real-time with smooth transitions between events.
